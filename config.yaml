      Format http(s)://<publicly-accessible-dns-name>/dex
      (Also referred to as issuer or OIDC provider ) This is the canonical URL that OIDC clients
      MUST use to refer to dex. If not specified, it defaults to dex-auth's local
      endpoint constructed from dex-auth's Kubernetes Service DNS name, the
      Service port and Dex's endpoint, that is http://<dex-auth-app-name>.<namespace>.svc:5556/dex.
      The default is set by the charm code, not the configuration option.
      This configuration must be set when using a Dex connector that will try to reach Dex from outside
      the cluster, thus it should be a publicly accessible endpoint, for example https://my-instance.in-my-cloud.some-cloud.com/dex
